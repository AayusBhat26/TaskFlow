# Sound Effects Implementation for Task and Question Completion

## Overview
Added comprehensive sound notification system for task completion and DSA question completion in TaskFlow. The implementation uses the existing Howler.js library and leverages the existing sound files in the public/music directory.

## Features Implemented

### ðŸŽµ Sound Library (`lib/soundEffects.ts`)
- **CompletionSoundEffect enum**: Defines different types of completion sounds
- **pathsToCompletionSounds**: Maps sound types to audio file paths
- **Sound Functions**:
  - `playTaskCompletionSound()`: Digital sound for task completion
  - `playQuestionCompletionSound()`: Bird sound for DSA question completion
  - `playSuccessSound()`: Bell sound for general success
  - `playAchievementSound()`: Fancy sound for achievements
  - `playCompletionSound()`: Generic completion sound player

### ðŸŽ¯ Task Completion Sounds
Sound effects are triggered when tasks are marked as completed in:

1. **useTasks Hook** (`hooks/useTasks.tsx`)
   - Plays sound when completeTask function is called
   - Uses dynamic import for optimal loading

2. **TaskCompleteButton** (`components/tasks/TaskCompleteButton.tsx`)
   - Plays sound immediately when button is clicked
   - Provides instant audio feedback

3. **useCompleteTask Hook** (`hooks/useCompleteTask.tsx`)
   - Plays sound on successful task completion
   - Integrates with success notifications

4. **TasksModal** (`components/tasks/TasksModal.tsx`)
   - Plays sound when tasks are completed via the modal
   - Enhanced completion experience

### ðŸ§© DSA Question Completion Sounds
Sound effects are triggered when DSA questions are marked as completed in:

1. **DSA Practice Page** (`app/[locale]/dsa/page.tsx`)
   - Quick completion button: Plays sound immediately on click
   - Status selector: Plays sound when status changes to "COMPLETED"
   - Enhanced toast notifications for completed questions

## Sound Mappings

| Action | Sound File | Description |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| Task Completion | `/music/digital.mp3` | Clean digital sound for task completion |
| DSA Question Completion | `/music/bird.mp3` | Pleasant bird sound for learning achievements |
| General Success | `/music/bell.mp3` | Classic bell sound for success |
| Achievements | `/music/fancy.mp3` | Special sound for major accomplishments |

## Technical Implementation

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallback if sound files are missing
- Console warnings for sound loading/playing errors
- No blocking of main functionality if sounds fail

### Performance
- Uses Howler.js for optimal audio performance
- Dynamic imports to avoid blocking main thread
- Configurable volume levels per sound type
- HTML5 audio for better browser compatibility

### Volume Settings
- Task Completion: 50% volume
- Question Completion: 60% volume
- Success: 60% volume
- Achievement: 70% volume

## Usage Examples

### Programmatic Usage
```typescript
import { playTaskCompletionSound, playQuestionCompletionSound } from '@/lib/soundEffects';

// For task completion
playTaskCompletionSound();

// For DSA question completion
playQuestionCompletionSound();

// With custom volume
playTaskCompletionSound(0.3); // 30% volume
```

### Integration Points
- **Automatic**: Sounds play automatically when tasks/questions are completed
- **Immediate Feedback**: Sounds play on button click for instant feedback
- **Success Notifications**: Enhanced toast messages with appropriate emojis

## Browser Compatibility
- Works with all modern browsers that support HTML5 audio
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- No dependencies beyond existing Howler.js library

## Future Enhancements
- User preference settings to enable/disable sounds
- Additional sound themes (workspace-specific sounds)
- Sound effects for other actions (pomodoro completion already has sounds)
- Achievement-based sound variations
- Accessibility options for hearing-impaired users

## Files Modified/Created

### Created Files:
- `lib/soundEffects.ts` - Sound effects utility library
- `scripts/test-sound-effects.js` - Test script for verification

### Modified Files:
- `hooks/useTasks.tsx` - Added task completion sounds
- `components/tasks/TaskCompleteButton.tsx` - Added immediate sound feedback
- `hooks/useCompleteTask.tsx` - Added completion success sounds
- `components/tasks/TasksModal.tsx` - Added modal completion sounds
- `app/[locale]/dsa/page.tsx` - Added DSA question completion sounds

## Test Results
âœ… All sound files present and accessible
âœ… Sound effects library properly exported
âœ… Implementation verified in all target components
âœ… Howler.js dependency confirmed
âœ… No breaking changes to existing functionality

The sound effects system is now fully integrated and ready for production use. Users will receive immediate audio feedback when completing tasks and DSA questions, enhancing the overall user experience and providing satisfying completion cues.
