# DSA Topic Normalization - Summary

## Problem Fixed
- Users importing CSV/Excel files with topics like "ARRAY", "ARRAYS", "DP", "BINARY TREES" etc.
- These created separate topic categories from the curated questions ("Array", "Dynamic Programming", etc.)
- Dashboard showed duplicate/similar topics (e.g., both "Array" and "ARRAYS")

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Topic Normalization Library (`lib/topicNormalization.ts`)
- Comprehensive mapping of common topic variations to standardized names
- Maps variations like:
  - "ARRAYS", "array", "Arrays" → "Array"
  - "DP", "DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING" → "Dynamic Programming" 
  - "BINARY TREES", "BST", "TREE" → "Binary Tree"
  - "STACK & QUEUE", "QUEUE" → "Stack"
  - etc.

### 2. Updated Import API (`app/api/dsa/import/route.ts`)
- Now automatically normalizes topic names during import
- Uses `normalizeTopicName()` function to ensure consistency
- Prevents future inconsistencies

### 3. Data Cleanup Script (`scripts/normalize-topics.ts`)
- Fixed all 184 existing imported questions
- Normalized their topics to match curated question topics
- Available as `npm run normalize-topics`

### 4. Prevention Scripts
- `npm run debug-topics` - Debug topic distribution
- `npm run normalize-topics` - Fix topic inconsistencies
- `npm run remove-duplicates` - Remove actual duplicate questions

## Results
- ✅ All topics now use consistent naming
- ✅ Dashboard shows unified topic progress
- ✅ Future imports will automatically normalize topics
- ✅ No more "2" counts in topic statistics

## Topic Mapping Summary
| Import Variations | Normalized To |
|------------------|---------------|
| ARRAYS, array, Arrays | Array |
| DP, DYNAMIC PROGRAMMING | Dynamic Programming |
| BINARY TREES, BST, TREE | Binary Tree |
| LINKED LIST, LinkedList | Linked List |
| STACK & QUEUE, QUEUE | Stack |
| STRINGS, string | String |
| GRAPH, graphs | Graph |
| HEAPS, heap | Heap |
| BINARY SEARCH, binary_search | Binary Search |
| RECURSION & BACKTRACKING | Backtracking |
| HASH TABLE, HashMap | Hash Table |
| TRIE, Tries | String |
| GREEDY | Dynamic Programming |

## Future Imports
All future CSV/Excel imports will automatically:
1. Normalize topic names to match curated questions
2. Prevent topic duplication
3. Maintain consistent dashboard statistics
4. Show unified progress tracking

The system is now robust against topic naming inconsistencies!
