# DSA Question Completion Points System

## Implementation Summary

### ✅ Points Configuration (lib/points.ts)
```typescript
DSA_QUESTION: {
  EASY: 30,     // Easy questions: 30 points
  MEDIUM: 50,   // Medium questions: 50 points  
  HARD: 80,     // Hard questions: 80 points
}
```

### ✅ Existing Points Preserved
- **Task Completion**: 5 points (unchanged)
- **Pomodoro Sessions**: 10-45 points based on duration (unchanged)

### ✅ Updated DSA Progress API (app/api/dsa/progress/route.ts)
- Awards points when a question status changes to 'COMPLETED'
- Only awards points once per question (prevents duplicate points)
- Uses proper difficulty-based point calculation
- Creates point transaction record for tracking
- Handles errors gracefully (points failure won't break progress update)

### ✅ Points System Integration
```typescript
// Function to award DSA question points
recordDSAQuestionCompletion(
  userId: string,
  questionId: string, 
  questionTitle: string,
  difficulty: 'EASY' | 'MEDIUM' | 'HARD'
)
```

### ✅ Point Transaction Tracking
- Type: 'DSA_QUESTION_COMPLETED'
- Description: "Completed {difficulty} DSA question: {title}"
- Points: 30/50/80 based on difficulty
- Related ID: Question ID for reference

### ✅ User Flow
1. User completes a DSA question (marks as 'COMPLETED')
2. System checks if question was previously completed
3. If first completion, calculates points based on difficulty:
   - Easy → 30 points
   - Medium → 50 points  
   - Hard → 80 points
4. Updates user's total points
5. Creates transaction record for audit trail
6. Returns success response

### ✅ Database Updates
- Updates `user.points` field with increment
- Creates `pointTransaction` record with:
  - userId
  - points awarded
  - type: 'DSA_QUESTION_COMPLETED'
  - description with question details
  - questionId as relatedId

### ✅ Prevention of Double Points
- Checks if existing progress status was already 'COMPLETED'
- Only awards points on first completion
- Handles case where user marks question as completed multiple times

### ✅ Error Handling
- Points recording wrapped in try-catch
- Progress update continues even if points recording fails
- Error logged but doesn't break user experience

## Testing Scripts Available
- `npm run test-points` - Test point calculation functions
- `scripts/test-dsa-points-integration.ts` - Test full integration

## Point Values Summary
| Activity Type | Points | Notes |
|---------------|--------|-------|
| Easy DSA Question | 30 | New implementation |
| Medium DSA Question | 50 | New implementation |
| Hard DSA Question | 80 | New implementation |
| Task Completion | 5 | Unchanged |

The system is now ready to award points for DSA question completions while preserving the existing points structure for tasks and pomodoro sessions.
